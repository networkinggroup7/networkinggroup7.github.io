		<p style="margin: 50px;"><b>Networking devices</b> - refers to equipment that connects to a network, which includes computers, printers and most A/V gear (receivers, media hubs and servers, Blu-ray players, etc.), which operate in an Ethernet or Wi-Fi network or both. Smartphones and tablets all have Wi-Fi but are considered mobile devices. The satisfaction of learning the use of these devices is that it can help design and built a network that is secure and serves the organization well. However, to ensure the ongoing security and availability of the network, a person should carefully monitor the network devices and activity around them in order to quickly spot hardware issues, configuration issues and attacks.</p>

		<hr style="clear: both;">

		<h2>Network Topology</h2>

		<hr style="clear: both">
		<p><b>Network topology</b> - refers to the manner in which the links and nodes of a network are arranged to relate to each other. Topologies are categorized as either physical network topology, which is the physical signal transmission medium, or logical network topology, which refers to the manner in which data travels through the network between devices, independent of physical connection of the devices.</p>

		<p><b>Physical topology</b> - indicates arrangement of different elements of a network. It reflects physical layout of devices and cables to a form a connected network. It is concerned with essentials of network ignoring minute details like transfer of data and device type. It is the actual layout of the wires or media operated in the specified topology.</p>

				<tr>
					<th>Bus Topology<br>
					<img src="images/bus.png" height="150px"></th>
					<td>Used for Small workgroup local area networks (LANs) whose computers are connected using a thinnet cable. Trunk cables connecting hubs or switches of departmental LANs to form a larger LAN. Backboning, by joining switches and routers to form campus-wide networks.</td>

				<tr>
					<th>Ring Topology<br>
					<img src="images/ring.png" height="150px"></th>
					<td>A topology for a Local Area Network (LAN) in which every device has exactly two neighbours for communication purposes. Typically, all messages travel through a ring in the same direction. A failure in any cable or device breaks the loop and will take down the entire segment.</td>
				</tr>

					<th>Star Topology<br>
					<img src="images/star.png" height="150px"></th>
					<td>All nodes are individually connected to a central connection point, like a hub or a switch. A star takes more cable than e.g. a bus, but the benefit is that if a cable fails, only one node will be brought down.</td>

		    <div id="home" class="tab-pane fade in active">
				<h3>Application Layer: Layer 7</h3>
				<p>At this layer, both the end user and the application layer interact directly with the software application. This layer sees network services provided to end-user applications. The application layer identifies communication partners, resource availability, and synchronizes communication.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
				<h3>Presentation Layer: Layer 6</h3>
		      	<p>The presentation layer formats or translates data for the application layer based on the syntax or semantics that the application accepts. Because of this, it at times also called the syntax layer. This layer can also handle the encryption and decryption required by the application layer.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
				<h3>Session Layer: Layer 5</h3>
				<p>The session layer controls the conversations between different computers. A session or connection between machines is set up, managed, and termined at layer 5. Session layer services also include authentication and reconnections.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
				<h3>Transport Layer: Layer 4</h3>
				<p>The transport layer manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. It regulates the size, sequencing, and ultimately the transfer of data between systems and hosts. One of the most common examples of the transport layer is TCP or the Transmission Control Protocol.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
				<h3>Network Layer: Layer 3</h3>
				<p>The network layer is responsible for receiving frames from the data link layer, and delivering them to their intended destinations among based on the addresses contained inside the frame. The network layer finds the destination by using logical addresses, such as IP (internet protocol). At this layer, routers are a crucial component used to quite literally route information where it needs to go between networks.</p>
		    </div>
		    <div id="menu5" class="tab-pane fade">
		      	<h3>Data Link Layer: Layer 2</h3>
		      	<p>At the data link layer, directly connected nodes are used to perform node-to-node data transfer where data is packaged into frames. The data link layer also corrects errors that may have occurred at the physical layer.</p>

				<p>The data link layer encompasses two sub-layers of its own. The first, media access control (MAC), provides flow control and multiplexing for device transmissions over a network. The second, the logical link control (LLC), provides flow and error control over the physical medium as well as identifies line protocols.</p>

		    <div id="menu6" class="tab-pane fade">
		      	<h3>Physical Layer: Layer 1</h3>
		      	<p>Considered as the lowest layer of the OSI Model. It is responsible to electrically or optically transmitting raw unstructured data bits across the network from the physical layer of the sending device to the physical layer of the receiving device. The specified layer includes the specifications such as voltages, pin layout, cabling, and radio frequencies. At the physical layer, one might find “physical” resources such as network hubs, cabling, repeaters, network adapters or modems.</p>

		<p style="padding-bottom: 0px;"><b>Peer-to-peer Communication</b> - Each layer provides a protocol to communicate with its peer. When a packet is transmitted by a layer, a header is added to the data to be sent. The protocol data unit so-formed, is passed via a service access point to the layer below. This is then sent using the service of the next lower protocol layer.</p>

				<h3>Application Layer: Layer 4</h3>
				<p>The top-most layer of four-layer TCP/IP model. Application layer is placed on the top of the Transport layer. Application layer defines TCP/IP application protocols and how host programs interface with Transport layer services to use the network.</p>

				<p>Includes all the higher-level protocols like:</p>
				<ul style="padding-left: 150px;">
					<li>FTP -  File Transfer Protocol</li>
					<li>HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol</li>
					<li>SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</li>
					<li>DNS - Domain Naming Systems</li>
					<li>TFTP - Trivial File Transfer Protocol</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		    </div>
		    <div id="twomenu1" class="tab-pane fade">
				<h3>Transport Layer: Layer 3</h3>
		      	<p>The third layer of the four-layer TCP/IP model. The position of the Transport layer is between Application layer and Internet layer. The purpose of Transport layer is to permit devices on the source and destination hosts to carry on a conversation. Transport layer defines the level of service and status of the connection used when transporting data.</p>

				<p>The main protocols included at Transport layer are:</p>
				<ul style="padding-left: 150px;">
					<li>TCP - Transmission Control Protocol</li>
					<ul>
						<li>FTP -  File Transfer Protocol</li>
						<li>HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol</li>
						<li>SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</li>
						<li>DNS - Domain Naming Systems</li>
					</ul>
					<li>UDP - User Datagram Protocol</li>
					<ul>
						<li>DNS - Domain Naming Systems</li>
						<li>TFTP - Trivial File Transfer Protocol</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
		    </div>
		    <div id="twomenu2" class="tab-pane fade">
				<h3>Internet Layer: Layer 2</h3>
				<p>The position of Internet layer is between Network Access Layer and Transport layer. Internet layer pack data into data packets which contain source and destination address (logical address or IP address) information that is used to forward the datagrams between hosts and across networks.</p>

				<p>The Internet layer is also responsible for routing in the IP</p>
				<ul style="padding-left: 150px;">
					<li>IP - Internet Protocol</li>
					<ul>
						<li>TCP - Transmission Control Protocol</li>
						<li>UDP - User Datagram Protocol</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
		    </div>
		    <div id="twomenu3" class="tab-pane fade">
				<h3>Network Access Layer: Layer 1</h3>
				<p>The first layer of the four-layer TCP/IP model. Network Access Layer defines the details of how data is physically sent through the network, including how bits are electrically or optically signaled by hardware devices that interface directly with a network medium, such as coaxial cable, optical fiber, or twisted pair copper wire.</p>

					<p>Network Layer involves the following components that will continue from the IP:</p>
				<ul style="padding-left: 150px;">
					<li>Internet</li>
					<li>Personal LAN</li>
					<li>Other LANs and WANs</li>
					<ul>
						<li>IP - Internet Protocol</li>
